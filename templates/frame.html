    Let's build some more complex use-cases. We might be interested to receive click-through
    pattern. Kind of, people went here, and then there.
    This patterns can be dangerous with regards to privacy, so please, be careful on the
    the length and on not sending patterns that span across different sites. In general,
    cross-site data should never be sent raw, because even if not UID is send, the urls
    on their own can identify the user implicity.
     For instance, I'm on my Facebook account (url1) and click on a link, so I go to url2
    outside Facebook. Let's supposed that both sites use green-tracker.
    If the patterns url1->url2 is sent, it can be the case that an attacker (in this case
    the green-tracker) could learn the identify of the user that visited url2. How?
    If url1 contains a ID of the user I might know his identity, as a matter of fact, if
    the page is only accessible after a signup, or if the url2 does not exists in the
    public version of url1 we can conclude that whoever clicked was the real owner of
    the account. Big privacy leak. Just to be clear that's what happens today in
    virtually any tracker, be it for ads ot for analytics, including GA (as per the example in
    the README.md).
     What if url1->url2 are both in Facebook, doesn't the same attack apply? Yes, but the risk
    is much smaller, and what is more important, the owner of the site has all the control
    to prevent this situation by not using a 3rd party system to track sensitive page his site.
    In case of cross-site, the site owner cannot prevent it in any way, because the destination
    is beyond his control. So, no blanket cross-site patterns when full URLS are involved.
     In this segment of the code we keep a history of the last 10 pages visited if they
    are not older than 1 hour. We must be careful of not keeping more history than strictly
    necessary because we are keeping urls in plain-text, which means that anyone with
    physical access to the computer could see.

    localStorage.setItem('gt:history', JSON.stringify(history));

    /*
    Once we have the history, we can check for fairly complex patterns. Let's
    start with checking if a campaign goal has been achieved.
     All campaign goals tracker by green-tracker must be in the client,
    in this case we only have one. We are tracking visits on page-10 of site4
    (assume is the thank you page after a sign-up) after visiting either
    page-10 in site5 or page-9 on site4 (which could hold ads suggesting you
    to signup).
     Thanks to the history is evident that we can validate if the goal
    has been achieved. In fact, we can add additional conditions such as
    time between start and end to be less than 30 minutes and less than
    4 hops away. Naturally, more sophisticated conditions could apply.
     There are a some considerations when tracking goals.
    All goals observed by the tracker must be explicitly defined in the
    client. Otherwise they could not be reported. Consequently,
     New goals need to be propagated to all client, this is really a problem
    because they can be served via CDN and loaded as an external resource, a
    applying caching, etc.
     However once every so often users will have to download them all, a quick
    back on the envelope calculation yields ~200KB per thousand goals (once on a
    proper structure). That's not that much, but a typical tracker can have
    hundreds of thousands. So goal calculation will become a bit more expensive
    in terms of network transfer but at least you will not be broadcasting
    everywhere you go. It is important to mention too, that nothing prevent
    us too load goals as we visit sites, for instance, after a visit to site1.com
    we could load only goals that apply to that site rather than loading all
    goals.
     From the customer of the tracker, having the goals on the client side also
    raise few concerns. Mostly, a) their inability to do retrospective analysis,
    no way around it. And, b) they might not like to have their campaign goals
    exposed to everyone to see. As a matter of fact, an end-user I would welcome
    this; transparency is always good. However, the companies whose are the customers
    of tracker are also competing among themselves, so too much transparency can
    affect them negatively.
     For the sake of not adding more complexity in this walk-through we will keep
    'campainGoals' as plain text. However it should be evident that both 'target'
    and 'sources' are candidates to be truncated hashes, so that the urls are
    obfuscated to all but the owner of the goal. Furthermore, the 'labels'
    that contain customer specific information can be replaced by ids to be
    resolved at collection time in the server-side.
     Let us stress that campaignGoals should be loaded as an external resource, where
    both urls and labels are obfuscated, instead of declared here in plain text.

    /*
    To finish the use-cases let us introduce a last one that is conceptually different.
    Up until now we have used the client state (the localStorage) to mark whether a message,
    a signal, has been already sent to the backend or not.
     The state however can also be used to aggregate data across time by user, for instance,
    we might be interested in knowing the number of different pages loads that a user does
    on a site plus the average time spend on the pages of the site.
     Naturally, we cannot do the aggregation on the server-side, because it would require
    the user to send a UID, thus compromising his privacy. Instead, we will accumulate the
    statistics on the localStorage by the desired time-bucket.
     Regularly, the user will check if there are aggregated statistics whose time-resolution
    has already elapsed; for instance, if we keep the statistics per hour, any statistic
    for previous hours will not change further, so it can be sent.
     This approach is very light-weight but it has a couple of considerations:
     1) In the ideal case we can only send statistics after the time-resolution has elapsed, there
    is a delay on the data received. This issue can be minimized in different ways. First, we can
    send partials, however, that is not very straight-forward to implement properly, and it does
    not completely eliminate the issue. Another solution to combine the aggregation with the
    reporting-like behaviour explained previously. There is no rule against reported aggregates every
    hour, but under certain circumstances report immediately. A typical case would be a system that
    measures the latency of requests. We could aggregate response time statistics to obtain the
    median, 99th, etc. every hour, which will be send once the hour has passed, so 1 hour delay.
    At the same time, we could send a signal if the user experiences more than 5 request with a
    response time above a threshold, thus, obtaining a real-time alert.
     2) The second consideration is that there is no guarantee that the aggregated data will ever
    be sent. There is no guarantee that the aggregated data with a time resolution
    of 1 hour will be send immediately after 1 hour either. Aggregated data will only be sent when
    the user runs this script, and there is no guarantee that the user will run the script ever
    agent. Naturally it is highly unlikely that the script is never run again, since this script
    is mean to be present in many pages of many different sites. Nevertheless, it is something
    that needs to be considered.
     For the site1.com only, to simplify the code, we will report the average number of page-loads
    and the times spend on a page by user by hour. So, the site1.com owner will be able to
    categorize the engagement of his users by pageloads and by time-spend without compromising
    his user's privacy. In fact, the site1.com will be able to measure time spend on the page
    by user without having to resort to put a time-beacon on the users computer; a time-beacon
    typically pings a backend every few seconds to signal that the user is still on a page, this
    approach is very wasteful, in particular on the mobile because the continuous use of the radio
    drains the battery. With the client-side aggregation proposed by Green-tracker, beacons are
    no longer necessary as we will see in the following example.

    explict association between the messages.
     Ideally we should send each message with a random interval, to break any temporal correlation
    that green-tracker.com could use to try to guess if the messages come from the same user. This is
    done by design in the case of messages generated from different pages, but for messages from
    the same page it is problematic to add the random interval because once the user leaves the page
    the script will stop running and we risk losing them. What we can do at least is randomize them to
